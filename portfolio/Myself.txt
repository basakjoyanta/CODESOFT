Hi,My name is Joyanta Basak and I’ve been developing websites with HTML CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.  I am self-taught, but I honestly believe that with the amount of tutorials on YouTube, and in the Javascript community, one can learn everything–including HTML, CSS and PHP, without going to college. I’ve tried to make my living as a freelance front end web developer. I am looking for a job-security, and decided to apply for the position you advertise. Besides work I am just a normal family man who enjoys spending time with his wife, and working in the garden in his spare time.
